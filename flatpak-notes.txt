Notes for flatpack until I make scripts

- Fix KDE putting user fonts in a unused location
ln -s ~/.local/share/fonts ~/.fonts

- Fix KDE not able to edit applications from menu
cp /var/lib/flatpak/app/xxx/current/active/export/share/applications/xxx.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/

- Fix mozc with flatpak apps
Install fcitx-mozc, select fcitx5 launcher from virtual keyboards
Edit application .desktop, add --enable-wayland-ime to end of exec
